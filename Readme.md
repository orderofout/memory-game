Just a basic memory game
==============

Started out as a basic proof of concept for a client project which ultimatly never happened. The game uses local storage to save the end results, points are awarded based on number of clicks & and amount of time it takes to solve.

Thats it. Nothing really fancy. I added a Gruntfile after the fact with some bower dependencies. Eventually I'd like to port this into phonegap and make it an actual game with a few extra features.

Use it it you like, or don't. I don't care.
